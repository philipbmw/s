Little nervous watching the @Twins on TV today. Hopefully the game is closer than it was last night. #cmontwins #sundayfunday #park #sa
#hyunsookim will surly be booed running down carpet during opening day if he's on the roster #orioles #openingday
The fact that #HyunSooKim has a clause in his contract that says he can refuse being re-signed to the minor leagues is complete horseshit.
Hyun Soo Kim¡¯s Agency Says He Won¡¯t Accept Minors¡¦#BaltimoreOrioles #HyunsooKim #Newsstand #mlb #fantasybaseball
Baltimore @Orioles¡¯ Korean OF #HyunSooKim ¡®On the Bubble¡¯ #onthebubble @MLB
#HyunSooKim still hitless (0 for 21), @Orioles winless (0-9) 
@SteveDavisBmore isn't too worried about #HyunSooKim's start for the #Orioles during spring training...yet.
Tyler Tyler Collins. Do you understand you want the fans on your side. You deserved to get booed. That should not have happened. #Tigers #Collins
Holy Cow are you kidding me right now? @tigers #Collins WOW, saying F-U to the fans and flipping them off.....good luck Pal
Way to be classy #Collins! Waving your middle finger to the crowd
That had to be the silliest way to lose a consecutive scoreless innings streak 
If you drop a fly ball, you might want to pick it up. You might not want to flip off your fans either. #TylerCollins 
the worst thing I have ever seen done at a sporting event in Detroit I have attended over 1200 games in the city
Detroit #Tigers player #TylerCollins loses one in lights, loses cool, flips off fans. Did he go too far? 
#tylercollins "fuck em all" to the Tigers fans! Time to go back to minors and stay there Tyler. #byefelicia
Keuchel is doing his job out there but the Astros offense is not doing crap 
in spaceships they won't understand and me i ain't ever gonna understand this shit! lets #gostros #houstonastros
Holy shit he hit that fucking ball up there! #houstonastros
When people were talking shit all season long and still talking shit 
I feel like a girl that can't take the hint that her boyfriends a pice of shit #HoustonAstros #istilllovethem
The #HoustonAstros are the most profitable team in baseball. That is so pathetic how teams get away with that shit
Yooooo them #houstonastros are garbage!!! Wow they better get they shit right!!
Not even the players give a shit. #houstonastros #baseball
That ball was trapped! Get your shit together @MLB replay umpires in New York. Incompetent as fuck! #Giants
This team will absolutely lose 100 games this year. #Twins Fans need to stop going to Twin games immediately. FUCK THE POHLAD'S!
Watching the Twins is like beating yourself in the head with a hammer. #Jepsen
#Jepsen is horse shit. Fuck you #Twins
Braves we're going to be abysmal in 2016. Gonzalez can't make chicken soup with chicken s**t
The #Braves are really bad at baseball.  11-4 #Braves lose again in BOS/ATL.  They're here to play the #Cubs Friday-Sunday.
#Braves lose again. Out of 20 games to start the year, they've won only 4 of then. Fall 11-4 to the #RedSox and to 4-16 on the year.
This whole it's all about live sports/content has bubble signs. The money does have to come from somewhere. #Greinke deal
#Molina is a little ole bitch! Fuck the #Birds Fuck the #Cards Fuck Molina ole fuck boy ass bitch!
King Bitch was benched? Hope he doesn't throw a tantrum #Puig
Your a fucking bitch #puig. Sit down   Go roll some cigars #STLCards #STLvsLAD #NLDS
Glad his bitch ass didn't win #espn #puig the media ballooned his head
@BestFansStLouis "@redbirdsalm: @eddiegreen82 He's a little bitch! I wish he's thugs would find him. Take him back to Cuba" #Puig
I hate that fucker! Punk bitch! #puig #fuckLA #SFGiants
If you going to talk shit at least put your name next to the quote don't be a pussy #Puig is not the worst person in baseball
That's what you fucking get, Dave Roberts for taking out Ross Stripling during his no-hitter because of "pitch count." Pussy managing. #MLBs
Yes, #TylerCollins did indeed give #DetroitTigers crowd the finger.. And mumbled "F*** everybody".
Mark Trumbo leading the AL in batting avg.. Definitely not gonna last
Mark Trumbo is killing the O's on defense. It's a slow death, but it's happening.
@LyleMSpencer @Mtrumbo44 I never have seen him hotter!! it just means when he gets into one of his slumps it will be a long one.
Daniel Murphy couldn't do that #LGM
Daniel Murphy is not making that play. Not even close. Neil Walker is much better all around and I am hype.
Daniel Murphy and Hunter Pence are both so awkward; easily the two most uncomfortable people to watch play baseball.
Daniel Murphy will surely hit a slump soon
Fuck Daniel Murphy
Daniel Murphy at this point is not hot he's actually a good player. My opinion
Pitchers see Miggy in their nightmares. You could see him at the #ASG
lol remember when MLB overhyped the shit out of the Red Sox and their offense before the 2015 season
MLB TV is trash today, holy shit. Not working on PS4 or PC.
Nice one Lee Dea Ho. But the commentator is too noisy and disgusting?
I'm confused why didn't the athletics runner score in that first inning?
Stupid fucking music ruins it?
all i can think about is his poor arm after 
At Least injuries are not deliberately done like fucking football.
oh my gosh those poor people 
Hudson injury is BRUTAL! Oh man.
Stupid sport!
That stuff would suck?
that guys is tough as hell?
Baseball is such a bitch sport. Even the injuries suck?
That was scary?
Shut the fuck up minority?
My brother was at the first injury?
Fuck Bautista...cocky prick.
Hate the Yankees so much.
Bautista murders orioles pitchers who throw at him... just ask Oday?
Fuck A-Roid the fucking cheat?
damn daniel?
Gomez a pervert I think?
Who the hell would want to meet that scumbag, Carlos Gomez??
U suck?
U suck that is true?
Fucking gay?
Horrible game :(
Shame he got injured, was really having a solid year.
sucks he¢¥s gonna miss the postseason?
Totally awesome!
choo is my favorite?
Great catch
Fuck ya Pillar, Go Jays Go
the teams are so shitty?
Goddamn Kiermaier is so underrated
God ellsburry is a terrible fielder?
I feel so bad for that old guy with the fire works?
And I thought my week was going bad?
fuck all you?
curveball is so nasty?
Haters gonna hate?
@patcarroll11 after seeing your top 4 hated teams I had a feeling you were biased against a lot of teams #BrandonPhillips #Choo #Cleveland
Kick his ass, sea bass!  #indians #royals #Hannahan #Choo
Settle down you weak little Asian man!! #jays #Indians #Choo you got nothing #MLB
Hey buddy, the ball is behind you. It's not in your glove. #Puig #Dodgers
Diet no longer the primary cause of high blood pressure. No no....its now Brian Wilson. #Dodgers  #wilson #facepalm
Why does #Mattingly insist on still using #Wilson in important situations?  Makes absolutely no sense.  #Dodgers
Chris Sale's curve was so fucking dirty omg.
This is painful to watch?
SOME PLAYERS DONT KNOW HOW TO CATCH?
@InMetsWeTrust and u can trust that i won't fuck up like daniel murphy did!!!
Baseball announcers are so polite. Daniel Murphy fields a ball I'm quite certain my 5 mo old could handle. Lauded for his great play.
Daniel Murphy showing the range? Nice! Easy double play once he gets there with Molina running
Daniel Murphy was a huge part of the Mets run last year but w/ the progress of their starting pitchers +neil Walker this yrs team is better
This Daniel Murphy move was so solid he's a hitting machine
Daniel Murphy is one mighty fine looking man
Daniel Murphy has been such a great pick-up 
Sick. At least Daniel Murphy is bringing all the hits. Looks like laying in bed with baseball and draft tweets is all I got
Daniel Murphy well done! #Nationals
@MeddoconlineDr Daniel Murphy was your best player
Enjoy watching how hard Daniel Murphy plays the game.
Byung Ho Park. What a guy. Favorite player on the entire very successful Twins Roster
Byung Ho #Park's another moon shot (Korean call)
Byung Ho Park's monster home run on Korean play-by-play. Very cool!  
Seung-hwan Oh has emerged as 1  of the most reliable pitchers in this bullpen. 
Good to see Seung Hwan Oh pitch two scoreless today in the 7th and 8th for the Cardinals.  The Korean is effective. 
Seung Hwan Oh really impressing in his "rookie" season. Has not allowed a hit
Congratulations to Seung Hwan Oh on his first career Major League win! 
This. Is. Perfect.
I didn't understand a single word, but it still was awesome!!
.@BrianDozier can't wait to get to the @Twins clubhouse for their postgame dance party: "It's good to be back home
Those were some awesome catches!
This is amazing?
They have such nice booty !
yeah that was amazing and great?
One of the reasons why I love baseball!
Nice video, exciting to watch.
so nice.
Touching?
it's cool that the players do that?
hes going to do better next year?
He's got a pretty good curve.
I love this guy?
thanks for your ability?
My favorite player?
Perfect plays and bgm..
God I love baseball?
Keep up the good work?
Awesome video! Great channel. I'm subbed.
Nice inside the park home runs?
Good running?
Scoreless innings streak snapped for Cardinals' Oh Seung-hwan 
Seung Hwan Oh has been quietly awesome in the first tenth of the season. Great signing
Good to see Seung Hwan Oh pitch two scoreless today in the 7th and 8th for the Cardinals.  The Korean is effective
The best pitcher in Major League Baseball!
What a Priceless?
I'm looking forward to Kimbrel closing games for the Sox.
Any more closer/ relief pitchers in mind?
Love Kimbrel : )
Awesome pitching matchup: Garcia vs. Greinke. 
Congrats to Zack Greinke on his first career pinch hit.
Dae Ho #Lee #Mariners, a multi-hit game today
Congrats to Dae-ho #Lee on #MLB debut today with #Mariners. Here's video I shot 3-26 in AZ - crowd chants "Dae-ho"
omg finalllly! Dae ho!!! #GoMariners #neededthat #mariners #win #daeho #walkoff
He used to be a slugger for both Korea & Japan. Now he's warming up for the big league's title!!! Go, #Daeho!!
Beautiful #HomeRun #DAEHO is awesome!!!
#Collins! RT @tigers: Tyler Collins with a diving grab to end the sixth inning. We're still scoreless from Disney. #Tigers
Wish i had some kahlua to drink in shin soo choo's honor for tonight's performance. #choo #indians
Thank God for #Choo. The #Indians need him right now. C'mon #Tribe!!!
The greatest throw I've ever seen!  #Puig
Lets go kershaw you got!!! #Dogers #NoHitter #Kershaw
@Dodgers looked good tonight. #Kershaw was dealing! #thinkblue #go #Dogers
I'm pretty sure #Neil #Walker is my favorite #NL 2nd Baseman. #MLB #Pirates.
There's our MVP #donaldson #jays
What a beautiful double play #Machado
I'm just say it now. I believe they win this game!!. #Cubs #GoCubsGo #Arrieta
Baseball has never seen a pitcher like Noah #Syndergaard, and it's raising one big concern http://uk.businessinsider.com/noah-syndergaards-pitching-raising-big-concern-2016-4?¡¦ #Mets
#Noah #Syndergaard has pitch that's nearly impossible hit, it's baffling baseball world
THOR...THE BOSS!! #Syndergaard #Mets #LGM
So not only is #syndergaard hot ... He's also a beast #34 #mets
Awesome job today @Noahsyndergaard!! Was so much fun watching in person! #LGM #Mets #NYMets #MetsWin #Syndergaard
#Syndergaard is a MONSTER!
KKK FINAL BOSS
Yes, #Uribe! Still love you, Papi! #Dodgers
Yeah he played in a small stadium but most of his homers cleared the fence by about 30-40 feet?
wow dudes like a korean barry bonds. What quick bat unreal power.
bryce harper is awesome ! lets go nats?
Guy was beast?
I love you Mike Trout?
S. Rodriguez is the best defensive player on the Pirates. I would love to see a defensive highlight reel of his.
Helton's play and the way he just ran in to the dugout has me laughing everytime!
On his way back! #Darvish #Rangers
MLB: The 5 Best Japanese Pitchers in Baseball History http://cht.st/pyhfs?#MLB #Maeda #Mariners #RedSox #Darvish #Dodgers #Nomo
I really hope #Darvish pitches for Frisco on the 28th and not the 26th! I really wanna go but can't skip working a #Ranger #Yankee game
SageLinQ #Sports Yu #Darvish is impressed with his velocity after #Tommy John surgery http://www.sagelinq.com/APXC.mp3
#Rangers #Darvish feels strong, hopeful for mid-May return 
I hope Yu #Darvish, will going back next year with that kind of Slider #«À«ë«Ó«Ã«·«åêó #«¹«é«¤«À?
best part about the 2016 Rangers team? No more Ross freaking Detwiler. And #darvish. hopefully a lot of Darvish
Awesome to see #Darvish @ top of dugout every night! #LetsGoRangers
Here's #Osaka's own #MLB superstar #YuDarvish warming up. He's even more amazing in person! #Darvish #baseball
#Darvish and that beast arm @Rangers #gorangers
#Yu #Darvish is the first #Rangers pitcher to win at least 10 games in his 1st 3 @MLB seasons.
Kim's adjusting just fine and he will continue doing better, I'm sure of it.
@scottmerkin Have a great year #john Danks!!
Simmons is the best shortstop in baseball as of now.
This is awesome!!! Atta boy pujols
Dustin Pedroia? twice nice grab!
Nice job?
Robinson catch was fucking beautiful?
I love you cesar?
